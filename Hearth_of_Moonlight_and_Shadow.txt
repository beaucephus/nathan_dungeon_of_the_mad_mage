====== Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow ======
Created Saturday 20 February 2021

At 6th level, home can be wherever you are. 
During a short or long rest, you can invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your respite. 
At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and an invisible, 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on that point. 
Total cover blocks the sphere.

While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it.

The sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.
