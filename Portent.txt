Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the future begin to press in on your awareness. 
When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. 
You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. 
You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn.

Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.
